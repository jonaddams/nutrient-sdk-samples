# Simple Signing Demo

This sample demonstrates a basic PDF signing workflow with user role management.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic PDF viewer loading
- 🚧 Sidebar with user selector - TO DO
- 🚧 Drag-and-drop form fields - TO DO
- 🚧 Annotation permissions by user - TO DO
- 🚧 Digital signature via DWS API - TO DO

## Next Steps
1. Add sidebar component with user selector
2. Implement drag-and-drop for signature/initial/date fields
3. Add annotation permission logic based on assigned user
4. Integrate digital signing workflow
